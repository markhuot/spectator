description: ! "      CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.\n
  \     Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons,\n      JavaScript
  has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart.\n      CoffeeScript is an attempt
  to expose the good parts of JavaScript\n      in a simple way.\n"
